This podcast project explores my family history thru the art of storytelling. Family history is very important to me. If you are like me you grew up hearing stories about the old days from parents, aunts, and uncles and the like. Those stories are the essence of our family history. They inform us about where we came from, give us pride in ourselves and instill a sense of family.
There is a peculiarity in american black culture where older people don’t talk much about the past. Particularly about some of the injustices they endured,  or some impropriety. But there always that story the someone told somebody the help inform us about our past. I was looking for an alternative to approach to gathering family tree lists of names and dates. I am big fan of podcasts and I felt the podcast format would be ideal for capturing stories about my family, in order to preserve them and make it easy for others to digest.
I hope you find it interesting.# my-fam-podcast
